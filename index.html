      <h2>Movement through water:</h2>
      <p>
        Swim, glide, propel, float, paddle. This movement through water is aquatic locomotion. 
        Humans are well suited for this in our adaptation for boyancy and a mostly hairless, slender form.
        Other animals are much better, but we can manage quite well compared to many land mammals.  
        It turns out this is a healthy excercise and a necessary movement for humans. 
        <br>
        Swimming is a learned behavior. We are mainly terestrial or land based, but the benefits that we get from swimming outweigh avoiding water by a wide margin.
        Comfortability in water is natural, and it focuses our coordination with breath, the main life-force.
        Survival is regularly tested with the human ability to manage an aquatic locomotion event.
        <br>
        We should embrace this natural movement with our survival instinct and leverage it for peak performance. 
        Aquatic locomotion matery is our path towards a balanced kinesthetic solution to many health problems. 
        In adapting to movement through water we learn the following: 
        <ul> 
          <li>Bilateral coordination in breathing and propulsion.</li>
          <li>Drag reduction and streamlined efficiency.</li>
          <li>Resistance awareness and energy allocation.</li>
        </ul>
        Mastering the three concepts will place us in an optimized physical state of being.
      </p>
      <h2 id="section2">Endurance:</h2>
      <p>Sustained movement provides us with work that our bodies can respond to in a restorative way. 
        Swimming in particular has cardiovascular benefits that help maintain our efficient use of oxygen. 
        We all know that without oxygen we cannot survive; Swimming is an important vehicle for focused use of oxygen. 
        <br> 
        Things that are done repetatively and with rythm are an avenue for focused energy. 
        Focusing this energy will keep us alive longer with more balance and mindfulness than other movements. 
        Mainly because of the coordination that it requires to breathe, stay horizontal in the water, and propel oneself forward at the same time.
        <br> 
        Focused energy over time is how humans thrive. We have the potential for long lifespand and the capacity for incredible endurance. 
        The best way to practice endurace, balance, longer life, sustained breath, is by focusing on those same things regularly with an excercise that does a bit of each and over time. 
      </p>
      <h2 id="section3">Historical Boyancy</h2>
      <p> With humans biological makeup and the opportunity that relative neutral buyancy gives us, we can take advantage of and even compete in this motion.
        Boyancy promotes a natural survival state for humans, and can be used to control the breath, the body, and the mind.
        Hydrodynamics suggests that the power input balanced with reduced drag, in a state of controlled boyancy creates efficient propulsion through water. 
        Combining these things we see our opportunity for using this locomotion as a vehicle for promoting health and sustained life.

        Conclusion. 
      </p>
      <h2 id="section4">section 4</h2>
      <p>Here can be something totally different.
      <br>
        We can make it extend. 
        <br>
        Extend even further. 
        <br>
        It can really go forever. 
        <br>
        There will be a point where it gets consolidated. 
        <br> 
        I think this is plenty for now.
