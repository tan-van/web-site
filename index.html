    <h2>Live to learn</h2>

    <p> 
        I recently started learning to code and build the simplest of websites. 
        So far learning git and github and how to edit in vs code has been great.
        The resources available online make it easy to navigate small issues and complete a first project.

        Separately I have been learing the solidity programming language due to my interest in the web3 space. 
        I believe that this will be essential to easily making money on the internet in the future.
        Transactions against an online profile and skilled profile could enable work/live from anywhere. 
        I am excited to get used to using these tools for that reason.

        There is something very calming about the process of learning new things. 
        I like the quiet of being only in your mind trying to figure something out.
