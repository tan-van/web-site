      <h2>Movement through water:</h2>
      <p>
        Swim, glide, propel, float, paddle. This movement through water is aquatic locomotion. 
        Humans are well suited for this in our adaptation for boyancy and a mostly hairless, slender form.
        Other animals are much better, but we can manage quite well compared to many land mammals.  
        It turns out this is a healthy excercise and a necessary movement for humans. 
        <br>
        Swimming is a learned behavior. We are mainly terestrial or land based, but the benefits that we get from swimming outweigh avoiding water by a wide margin.
        Comfortability in water is natural, and it focuses our coordination with breath, the main life-force.
        Survival is regularly tested with the human ability to manage an aquatic locomotion event.
        <br>
        We should embrace this natural movement with our survival instinct and leverage it for peak performance. 
        Mastering aquatic locomotion is our path towards a balanced kinesthetic solution to many health problems. 
        In adapting to movement through water we improve the following: 
        <ul> 
          <li>Bilateral coordination.</li>
          <li>Fatigue resistance.</li>
          <li>Efficient energy allocation.</li>
        </ul>
        Mastering the three will place us in an optimized physical state of excellence.
      </p>
      <h2 id="section2">Endurance:</h2>
      <p>Sustained movement provides us with work that our bodies can respond to in a restorative way. 
        Swimming in particular has cardiovascular benefits that help maintain our efficient use of oxygen. 
        We all know that without oxygen we cannot survive; Swimming is an important vehicle for focused use of oxygen. 
        <br> 
        Things that are done repetatively and with rythm are an avenue for focused energy. 
        Focusing this energy will keep us alive longer with more balance and mindfulness than other movements. 
        Mainly because of the coordination that it requires to breathe, stay horizontal in the water, and propel oneself forward at the same time.
        <br> 
        Focused energy over time is how humans thrive. We have the potential for long lifespan and the capacity for incredible endurance. 
        The best way to practice endurace, balance, longer life, sustained breath, is by focusing on those same things regularly and over time. 
      </p>
      <h2 id="section3">Historical Boyancy:</h2>
      <p> With humans biological makeup and the opportunity that relative neutral buyancy gives us, we can take advantage of and even compete in this motion.
        Boyancy promotes a natural survival state for humans, and can be used to control the breath, the body, and the mind.
        Hydrodynamics suggests that power input balanced with reduced drag, in a state of controlled boyancy creates efficient propulsion through water. 
        Combining these things we see our opportunity for using this locomotion not just for survival but also to promote health and sustain life.
      <br> 
        From the comfort of the womb to forraging the sea, humans have adapted well in and around water. 
        We take advantage of a world that is about 70% water and our bodies that are around 60% water.
        Water is a part of us and we should all know how to move through it, as we move through life.
        <br> 
        As we become more comfortable in water we can use the experperience to become more comfortable with ourselves.
        With our senses shifted to new perspective and control of breath and life we can manage to control our mental state.
        Let the water be our meditation to focus on the elimination of stress and generate clear thought.  
        <br>  
      </p>
      <h2 id="section4">Practical Application:</h2>
      <p>It can start as simply as passive floating, but it should result in a regular pattern of movement that is sustainable, enjoyable, and repeatable. 
        Different strokes for different folks - as they say. Finding one that we can call our main thing is important.
        Switching it up is good, but its easier to focus and get good results if we pick one and stick with it. 
        This will be our go to, we need a place to practice then to nail the form so we don't do more harm than good. 
        <br>
        Regular practice will provide the perfect excuse to get out of something that we hate doing, nobody will shame us for excercise.
        If we get enough time in this can be our main excercise, or if we want to use it as a recovery acivity it is perfect for that too. 
        <br>
        Introverts benefit from swimming as it lets them spend time with their thoughts. Extroverts benefit because it forces them to. 
        <br>
        Endurance in the most low impact format; and as long as we maintain range of motion we will avoid and even heal injury with swimming.
        Swimming provides oxygenated bloodflow to the whole body. This is health preserving, this is active restoration. 
        <br>

      <h2 id="section5">Mission:</h2>
       <p>
        Aqualo is a company dedicated to those who appreciate the water and rely on its support for an active and healthy life. <br> 
        Also, to those who have yet to find this direction and need a starting path towards active recovery, heightened awareness, and physical well-being. 
        <br>
        Lets learn from the water to create resistance where we need, reduce friction for easy movement, and recruit just enough resource to efficiently glide through life.
